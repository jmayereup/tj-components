# TJ Components

A collection of premium, interactive web components for language learning, designed to be easily embedded into blogs or websites.

## CDN & Quick Start

You can use these components directly without downloading them by linking to the GitHub Pages CDN:

## Global Features

### 📄 Report Cards
Most components now include a "Report Card" feature. Students are prompted for their nickname and student number, generating a modal report card that they can screenshot and send to their teacher.

### 🎧 Unified Voice Selection
A consistent, icon-based voice selection overlay is available on components with Text-to-Speech. It automatically suggests the "Best" available voice for the target language while allowing students to choose alternatives.

### 🔗 Share as Quiz
By appending `?quiz=1` to the URL, components like `tj-listening` will hide transcripts and other "help" elements, turning the activity into a pure assessment mode.
